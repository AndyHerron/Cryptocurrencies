# Cryptocurrencies Unsupervised Machine Learning

## Overview of project
Using unsupervised machine learning, we were asked to analyse cryptocurrencies for an investment bank who is looking to offer a new
cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.

### Resources
* Data Sources: 'crypto_data.csv' from CryptoCompare
* Software: Jupyter Notebook, Python, machine learning algorithms, hvplot, StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, K-Means, PCA


## GitHub has disabled LFS for my account due to the fact that I have exceeded my data storage limit. 
### I have added "*.csv" to my .gitignore file, so my datafiles are not uploaded to my GitHub page.
